            About Us Having started off with one restaurant on Monaghan Street
            Newry back in 1983, we now have a well established chain of
            restaurants bringing our tasty food near you. We are a family owned
            business and it is this personal oversight and commitment of our
            team of staff, which we believe make the chain of restaurants so
            successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s no secret how we prepare our famous chicken burgers. We
            bread juicy pieces of chicken in a renowned seasoning, a special
            formula of herbs and spices and lightly fry it to golden perfection
            and indeed it still defines the irresistible flavour of Friar
            Tuck&apos;s chicken today.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have our own custom built chipping plant situated in the heart of
            Newry City where we make the chips used at our restaurants. Our
            chips are cut fresh every day and because they are not frozen, we
            are serving them to you at their very best.
          </p>
          <p>
            We put a lot of work into making our chips and very early in the
            morning staff prepare the chips for that day&apos;s use. Potatoes
            are put through various processes from de-stoning, peeling cutting
            and blanching to ensure a uniform chip at the end which you are used
            to seeing in our restaurants
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at Friar Tuck&apos;s we believe in supporting the local area
            and we provide employment within the local community as well as
            sourcing our ingredients from local businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have built a reputation for a quality and friendly service that&apos;s
            second to none, so whichever restaurant you visit you&apos;ll feel
            welcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            We opened our first ever restaurant in 1983 in Monaghan Street,
            Newry. Since then we have continually grown and opened further
            restaurants at various locations across the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1983 our Monaghan Street restaurant had just a few full time and
            several part time staff. We now employ over 150 people throughout
            our restaurants keeping employment in the locale of the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Friar Tuck&apos;s we have built our success on a winning
            combination of - a tasty menu, fair prices, friendly service and the
            close overview of the owners. The original menu of chicken burgers,
            beef burgers and chips has been updated over the years to add
            numerous dishes to the extensive menu including panini&apos;s and
            wraps.
